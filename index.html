        <p>Ggg programming language &amp; interpreter</p>

<p>To test compiler, go <a href="/Ggg/entry">here</a></p>

<p>Ggg is programming language built on top of brainfuck, which is built on top of
<code>P′′</code> programming language. It's very simple with just a few constructs and
symbols. Main reason of creation of this language is extending of brainfuck with
some quite needed features.</p>

<p>Valid symbols:
Symbols in tokens: <code>G</code>, <code>g</code>, other characters are used to break sets of symbols into tokens.</p>

<p>In Ggg version g there are 8 basic commands which are also only valid tokens, based on those from brainfuck:</p>

<p><code>G</code>   as <code>+</code> (increment byte)</p>

<p><code>g</code>   as <code>-</code> (decrement byte)</p>

<p><code>gG</code>  as <code>&gt;</code> (increment pointer, go right)</p>

<p><code>Gg</code>  as <code>&lt;</code> (decrement pointer, go left)</p>

<p><code>gg</code>  as <code>[</code> (if data byte zero, jump to forward <code>GG</code>)</p>

<p><code>GG</code>  as <code>]</code> (if data byte nonzero, jump backward to <code>gg</code>)</p>

<p><code>GGG</code> as <code>.</code> (output byte)</p>

<p><code>ggg</code> as <code>,</code> (input byte)</p>

<p>Commands should be divided by other characters or whitespace (including line
feed). Minimal requirement for the compilable program: </p>

<ul>
<li>there is either <code>gg</code> and <code>GG</code> in order, either there are none of those commands 
in the code. There is no need for having a parity of those tokens, only 
the order and having at least one <code>gg</code> and <code>GG</code> is needed. Programs breaking 
this rule would not compile. Not adhering to the rule results with
syntax error.</li>
<li>there are no symbols containing <code>g</code> and <code>G</code> without other characters that are also
not a command. So in Ggg g the symbol <code>gGg</code> is illegal and creates compilation
error, similar situation is with longer chains of <code>g</code>s and <code>G</code>s, like <code>gggg</code>.
Not adhering to the rule results with lexical error.</li>
</ul><p>Ggg is extensible, so there is possibility to add more commands, like declaring 
constants.
Proposed additional functionalities:</p>

<ul>
<li> Integer literals</li>
<li> Simple macros</li>
<li> Different I/O functions</li>
</ul><p>Ggg G integer literals known as g-binary
Literals are created using symbols g and G as one word without any other
characters inbetween. G symbol means g-binary 1 and g symbol means g-binary 0.
Scheme for creating integer g-binary literal:
g-binary-command address g-binary-value
Both address and g-binary-value can contain any number of (reasonable)
values, including not paired gg and GG.</p>
